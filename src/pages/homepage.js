    <h1>Pet Liberation Front</h1>
    <p>
      People like to think they know what's best for pets. They make up images of dogs running free in the countryside, of turtles playing in a pond, of frogs jumping on leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they create pale representations of these images, entrapping them in an urban context. Dogs run wild, but only when their owner gets home after 8 hours at work. Turtles swim, but only in the limited amount of water in their aquarium. Frogs jump, from the glass walls of their enclosures to the pale representation of their native plants.
    </p>
    <p>Pet ownership is the logical conclusion of the human urge to mess with wildlife. While many would agree that feeeding wildlife is problematic, the same people take in animals and anthropomorfize their needs.</p>
    <p>Pet Liberation Front is calling on all pet owners to set their pets free. Let them live their best life in the wild, free of the projections and expectations of their human masters.</p>
